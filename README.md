***Final Version***

I have been rather lazy updating here, but I'm now uploading the final version of the game, its playable and polished enough I feel.

I could have done a lot more with this project but I have felt from the start that this is a stepping stone into making a "real game", I learned a lot from this and I hope my next project will be even better for it

Also I am very proud to have finally finished a project that I started from scratch.
